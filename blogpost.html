				<h1> Why I Believe That Simplicity Is The Ultimate Sophistication </h1>

				<img src="img/blogpagepost.jpg" alt="Why I Believe That Simplicity Is The Ultimate Sophistication" />

				<p> If there was one thing that Apple taught me, was that; <b>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication</b>. First used in their AppleII promotion brochure, this has quite become the motto which the componay abides by. </p>

				<h2> Some Tips To Get You Started </h2>

				<h3> Always Have The Guts </h3>

				<p> I want people to appreciate web services. I am smitted by the beauty that is the internet. I want people's lives to be radically changed through web services. I want to be a Web Engineer. Networking, exposure, learning how things work, fighting out the outside world. I want to be challenged, pushed to my limits; as I believe that a person's best can only be achieved when he's pushed to the limit. </p>

				<blockquote>

				  <p><i>&ldquo;There is nothing a person can't do when his mind is on the job and there is passion for his work.&rdquo;</i>

				  <strong>&mdash;Vinay Bhat</strong></p>

				</blockquote>

				<p> Simply put; I don't want life to be a cake walk. I want to live and breathe with genius minds. I want to go to MIT. Life is only fruitful, rewarding, fulfilling when a person is challenged. Nothing, absolutely nothing beats the joy received after finishing a challenging task. I want to create, innovate and provide people with absolutely beautiful&mdash;both on the design and technical side&mdash;web services. </p>

				<h3> Never Give Away Any Oppurtinity </h3>

				<p>  The internet has a lot to offer and I am going to tap the potential with stellar products. There isn't much a person can't do when he believes in himself, and I believe in my views, in my visualisations. This isn't wishful thinking, it is a well worked out plan. Technology when combined with art can be revolutionary, when these two are combined, people are empowered with not only the technical power but also the kick to keep on doing something. </p>

				<h2> Go And Build Something! </h2>

				<p> You may have all the power you require for a certain task with the technology aspect of a product, but, for the continued use, good user experience you need it to be beautiful, easy to use. When a product is a pleasure to use, when one look forwards to use a device instead of it being a chore, then, it is truly a revelutionary product. Continued use is often underrated and market analysis call it a day by only testing the 'initial' reaction to a product. You are not going to use the product for a day if you have plans to buy it, you are expecting it to last you as long as possible. </p>

					    <ul>
					      <li>HTML(5)</li>
					      <li>CSS(3)</li>
					      <li>Accessibility</li>
					      <li>Lalalalalal</li>

					      <li>Typography</li>
					      <li>Grids</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
				</ul>

				<p> I believe that, when my products will keep on making people happy no matter what age, I will truly be happy. With web services, there is absolutely no hardware aspect and there is no subsequent wearing down of devices with time. They work radically on day 1 and they continue to work radically on day 1000 too. People often don't know what they want, and visionaries often bring out products that just fit the needs and do a lot more all the while touching people's hearts. </p>
